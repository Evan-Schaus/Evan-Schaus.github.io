      <h1>How to Play Goalkeeper</h1>
      <h4>A guide to mastering one of soccer's most important positions</h4>

          Playing goalkeeper requires fast reactions, sharp decision-making, and complete control of the penalty area.
          A keeper must stay alert, communicate constantly with defenders, and understand when to hold their position
          versus when to challenge for the ball.

          The basic stance begins with staying on the toes, knees slightly bent, and hands positioned forward and ready.
          Diving comes from pushing off the back foot, keeping hands strong, and driving toward the ball rather than
          falling sideways. Catching technique is equally critical: forming a secure hand shape and absorbing impact
          with the arms helps prevent rebounds.

        <p>
          Distribution is a major part of the role. Knowing how to throw, roll, or kick precisely can start attacks and
          relieve pressure. Communication is just as essential, as goalkeepers have the clearest view of the field and
          can guide defenders into better positions.

        <p>
          The key is consistency. Training footwork, handling, and positioning every day builds confidence and helps a
          keeper stay composed under pressure. Good goalkeepers lead the back line, react quickly, and read the game
          before threats appear.
